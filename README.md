# Microsoft-Azure-HoneyPot

# üõ°Ô∏è Azure Honeypot Project ‚Äì Monitoring Attacker TTPs using Cowrie & RDP

## üìñ Project Overview

To lure attackers, observe their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), and potentially collect toolkits for analysis without putting real systems at risk. By analyzing the behavior of attackers within the honeypot, security teams can gain valuable threat intelligence, improve their defenses, and potentially prevent future attacks on critical systems. 

This project sets up a live honeypot environment in **Microsoft Azure**, exposing:
- A **Linux SSH honeypot** using [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie)
- A **Windows Server RDP instance** with logging enabled

The goal is to **collect and analyze attacker techniques, tools, and procedures (TTPs)** in a controlled environment.


## üéØ Objectives

- Deploy and monitor a honeypot on Azure
- Capture real-world attacker activity (SSH and RDP)
- Analyze logs to extract meaningful threat intelligence
- Propose remediation strategies based on industry-standard cybersecurity controls
