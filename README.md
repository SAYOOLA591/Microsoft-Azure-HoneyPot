# Microsoft-Azure-HoneyPot

# üõ°Ô∏è Azure Honeypot Project ‚Äì Monitoring Attacker TTPs using Cowrie & RDP

## üìñ Project Overview

To lure attackers, observe their TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), and potentially collect toolkits for analysis without putting real systems at risk. By analyzing the behavior of attackers within the honeypot, security teams can gain valuable threat intelligence, improve their defenses, and potentially prevent future attacks on critical systems. 

This project sets up a live honeypot environment in **Microsoft Azure**, exposing:
- A **Linux SSH honeypot** using [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie)
- A **Windows Server RDP instance** with logging enabled

The goal is to **collect and analyze attacker techniques, tools, and procedures (TTPs)** in a controlled environment.

Key Metric Includes:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)

- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)

- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Workspace Alerts Triggered)

- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)

- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet/Network Security Groups logs)

üìä Setting Up Log Analytics in Azure

Azure Log Analytics is a service that helps you collect, store, and understand all the data (logs) generated by your Azure services so you can monitor, troubleshoot, and secure your cloud environment, set up and creating log analytical workspace and creating table for custom logs. [Sample-Log-Analytics](https://github.com/SAYOOLA591/Microsoft-Azure-HoneyPot/blob/main/log-analytics-workspace.md)

##

## üåê Data Collection Endpoint (DCE)
Think of a Data Collection Endpoint (DCE) as a doorway or a specific address in Azure where data can be sent for monitoring.

Its Purpose: A DCE provides the actual network endpoint (a URL) that data sources (like the Azure Monitor Agent or custom applications using the Logs Ingestion API) use to send their monitoring data.

##

## üì• Data Collection Rule (DCR)
A Data Collection Rule (DCR) is like a detailed instruction manual that tells Azure Monitor what data to collect, how to process it, and where to send it.

Its Purpose: DCRs define the logic for data collection. They specify:

Data Sources: What kind of data to collect (e.g., Windows Event Logs, Syslog, performance counters, custom text logs).

Filtering: Which specific events or metrics to include or exclude (e.g., only critical error events, specific performance counters). This helps reduce noise and costs.

Transformations (KQL): How to modify or enrich the data before it's stored (e.g., parse a log message, add new fields, mask sensitive information). This makes data more useful and can further reduce storage costs. 

[DCE-DCR Collection Guide](https://github.com/SAYOOLA591/Microsoft-Azure-HoneyPot/blob/main/dce-dcr.md)

##

‚öôÔ∏è Generate Events for Testing
- Simulate failed and successful login attempts on the Linux honeypot via SSH.
- Purpose: Trigger fresh log entries to test Log Analytics data flow.

##

üìä Query Cowrie Logs in Log Analytics

 -  Log Analytics Workspace ‚Üí Logs
 -  Run query on custom table:
 -  CowrieLog_CL
Using Regex to create a sample query for the custom logs: As seen below

##

It's an excellent idea to set up alerts for successful SSH logins in honeypot! This is a classic use case: Network-T1078-SSH Successful Login Based on MITRE ATT&CK T1078 (Valid Accounts). by extension, essentially to create an Action Group for Email Notification anytime there's [Successful Login](https://github.com/SAYOOLA591/Microsoft-Azure-HoneyPot/blob/main/setup-alert-SSH.md)

Windows Honeypot Setup & Log Strategy

Virtual Machine Setup:
Create a Windows VM, ensuring RDP port 3389 is publicly exposed. After deployment, log in via public IP/password to configure log forwarding to Azure Log Analytics.

Log Forwarding Strategy:
To manage costs, forward only specific Security logs Event ID 4625 (logon failure), and  using custom XPath filtering. Prioritize Event ID 4624 (successful logon), specifically tracking Logon Types 7 (Workstation Unlock) and 10 (RemoteInteractive) for critical Digital Forensic Analysis.

Create Data Collection Endpoint (DCE) & Data Collection Rule (DCR). Just as it was done with the Cowrie.

```plaintext

XPath Expressions
These are used in the custom data collection rules for targeting specific RDP logon types via Event IDs:

‚úÖ Successful RDP Logon (Event ID 4624, Logon Type 7 or 10)
*[System[(EventID=4624)]] and *[EventData[Data[@Name='LogonType'] = '10' or Data[@Name='LogonType'] = '7']]
Log name:

Security!*[System[(EventID=4624)]] and *[EventData[Data[@Name='LogonType'] = '10' or Data[@Name='LogonType'] = '7']]
‚ùå Failed RDP Logon (Event ID 4625)
*[System[(EventID=4625)]]
Log name:
Security!*[System[(EventID=4625)]]

```

##

These queries are used in Log Analytics to view and parse relevant RDP events.

‚úÖ Successful RDP Logon Query (Event ID 4624)

```kql
Event 
| where EventID == 4624
|extend event = parse_xml(EventData)
| extend src_ip = tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(event.DataItem)).EventData)).Data))[18].["#text"])
| extend username = tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(event.DataItem)).EventData)).Data))[5].["#text"])
| extend logontype = tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(event.DataItem)).EventData)).Data))[8].["#text"])
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, username, src_ip, logontype
```


‚ùå Failed RDP Logon Query (Event ID 4625)

```kql
Event 
| where EventID == 4625
| extend event = parse_xml(EventData)
| extend src_ip = tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(event.DataItem)).EventData)).Data))[19].["#text"])
| extend username = tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(event.DataItem)).EventData)).Data))[5].["#text"])
| extend logontype = tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(parse_json(tostring(event.DataItem)).EventData)).Data))[10].["#text"])
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, username, src_ip, logontype
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Remediation Plan NIST 800-61 Incident Handling Guide

üîê SC-7 ‚Äì Boundary Protection (NIST 800-53 Rev. 5)

| Element                | How SC-7 Applies                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **External Exposure**  | honeypot simulates exposed boundaries (e.g., open SSH and RDP ports), intentionally allowing inbound connections for study.                                                        |
| **Traffic Monitoring** | log and inspect traffic to/from the honeypot to detect suspicious activity‚Äîthis aligns with SC-7's focus on **monitoring boundary communications**.                             |
| **NSGs & Firewalls**   | Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) or firewalls can simulate boundary protections‚Äîeven if relaxed for honeypot purposes, they illustrate how **access would normally be restricted**. |
| **Segmentation**       | Placing honeypots in a separate virtual network or resource group prevents lateral movement, reflecting **internal boundary protection**.   

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

# üìÜ Daily Honeypot Summary (24h)

**Date**: July 30, 2025  
**Controls Applied**: Geo-blocking, NSG rules, password complexity

## üî¢ Metrics Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total login attempts | 9,035 |
| Unique source IPs | 17 |
| Successful logins | 1,556 |
| Scripts downloaded | 1 |
| Top Source Country | China |

## Attack Maps After Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hours after hardening.```




## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total login attempts | 0 |
| Unique source IPs | 0 |
| Successful logins | 0 |
| Scripts downloaded | 0 |

## üß† Observations

- NSG rule blocked ~70% of attempts
- Cowrie captured 1 new scripts with known malware hashes
- No successful RDP connections recorded

## üìå Actions

- Added attacker IPs to blocklist
- Submitted samples to VirusTotal
- Will rotate honeypot passwords and monitor trends

##

## üîé Threat Intelligence Integration

I implemented an automated playbook for IP address enrichment using Azure Logic App Designer, integrating with third-party services such as AbuseIPDB.

- Create an account on AbuseIPDB
- Obtain your API key
- Configure an HTTP GET request in the Logic App to query the IP reputation from the API
- Refer to AbuseIPDB's API documentation for request structure and parameters

üí° Why It Matters

The goal is to transform raw IP data collected from the honeypot into actionable threat intelligence. By automating enrichment, we can quickly determine whether an IP address is associated with known malicious activity‚Äîsaving time and supporting faster response decisions.

## üõ°Ô∏è üõ°Ô∏è Defense-in-Depth Simulation & Gaps Analysis

Why It Matters:

This honeypot simulates a typical enterprise environment where both Cowrie (SSH) and Windows RDP services are exposed to the internet. Without proper control layering and network segmentation, such exposure could lead to real compromise.

By analyzing this setup through the lens of defense-in-depth, we can identify critical weaknesses and recommend mitigations just as a Skilled SOC analyst would in a live network. The goal is to understand what would happen if this were a real production environment and to highlight the importance of proactive security controls.

‚ö†Ô∏è If This Were a Real Network

- An attacker could gain initial access through exposed SSH or RDP.
- Malware could be downloaded and executed, leading to persistence or lateral movement.
- Without segmentation, the attacker could pivot deeper into the network.

## üõ°Ô∏è How Controls Could Have Helped (MITRE Mapping)

| TTP | Control that would mitigate | Active | Outcome |
|-----|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| Initial Access (T1078) | Strong passwords, MFA | ‚úÖ | Prevent unauthorized logins |
| Execution (T1059) Payload delivery | Application control | ‚úÖ | Block script-based payloads |
| Persistence (T1547) | Endpoint detection (EDR) | ‚úÖ | Detect and stop cronjob/backdoor |
| Command & Control (T1071) | Network segmentation | ‚úÖ | Limit external callbacks |

üîç Gaps Identified & Fixes

| Gap | Suggested Fix | 
|-----|-----------------------------|
| No brute-force protection | Enable rate-limiting or fail2ban
| Outbound traffic unrestricted | Apply NSG rules for egress filtering
| No file analysis | Add sandboxing or hash scanning on downloads
| No alerting | Integrate with Azure Monitor or a SIEM for real-time alerts

---

## üß© Project Conclusion:

üéØ Why This Matters

This project demonstrates how real attackers behave when given access to seemingly open systems. By analyzing their actions, we can: 

- Understand how attacks evolve
- Identify common weak points
- Strengthen real infrastructure before it‚Äôs exploited

This honeypot helps bridge the gap between theory and real-world adversary behavior.
